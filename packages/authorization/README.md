# @nestjs-cls/authorization

An "Auth" plugin for `nestjs-cls` that simplifies verifying permissions by storing the authorization object in the CLS context.

The authorization object can be retrieved in any other service and used to verify permissions without having to pass it around. It can also be queried using the handy `RequirePermission` decorator.
