# `v4.x` â†’ `v5.x`

The `v5` major version is backwards compatible with `v4`, unless you used it with _manually-mounted_ `ClsMiddleware` to initialize the context.

The initial release of `v5.x` only supported NestJS 11, but backward support for NestJS 10 was added in `v5.2`

Compatibility with plugins remains unaffected and they only require a patch version bump to satisfy the peer dependency on `nestjs-cls`.

## Changed default ClsMiddleware mount point

Since NestJS v11 [now ships with Express v5 and Fastify v5](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide) which changes the route matching algorithm, the default mount point of the `ClsMiddleware` was changed from `'*'` to `'/'` (and from `(.*)` to `{*splat}` for Fastify).

If you used the automatic middleware mounting option in `ClsModule.forRoot` (i.e. `middleware: { mount: true }`), then you don't need to do anything.

If you manually mounted the middleware, you should adjust the mount point to `'/'` (or any other route that is relevant to you, according to the new matching algorithm).

For _Express_:

```diff
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
    configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
        consumer
            .apply(ClsMiddleware)
            // highlight-start
-            .forRoutes('*');
+            .forRoutes('/');
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

For _Fastify_

```diff
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
    configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
        consumer
            .apply(ClsMiddleware)
            // highlight-start
-            .forRoutes('(.*)');
+            .forRoutes('{*splat}');
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

:::info

Since `v5.2`, `nestjs-cls` adds back support for NestJS v10. The correct mount point will be decided automatically by detecting the version of either Express or Fastify.
