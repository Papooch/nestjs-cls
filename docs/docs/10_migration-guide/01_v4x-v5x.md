# `v4.x` â†’ `v5.x`

The `v5` major version is backwards compatible with `v4`, unless you relied on the `@nestjs/platform-express` with manually-mounted `ClsMiddleware` to initialize the context.

The breaking change _does not_ affect `@nestjs/platform-fastify`.

Compatibility with plugins remain unaffected and they only require a patch version bump to satisfy the peer dependency on `nestjs-cls`.

## Changed default ClsMiddleware mount point (Express)

Since NestJS v11 [now ships with Express v5](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide#express-v5), which changes the route matching algorithm, the default mount point of the `ClsMiddleware` was changed from `'*'` to `'/'` in `v5`.

If you used the automatic middleware mounting option in `ClsModule.forRoot` (i.e. `middleware: { mount: true }`), then you don't need to do anything.

If you manually mounted the middleware, you should adjust the mount point to `'/'` (or any other route that is relevant to you, according to the new matching algorithm).

```diff
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
    configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
        consumer
            .apply(ClsMiddleware)
            // highlight-start
-            .forRoutes('*');
+            .forRoutes('/');
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```
